1. Click on the image link at GitHub to verify that the git push succeeded. 
  - (Yes succeeded)
2. At this point, the number of commits is large enough that the output of git log -p is probably too big to fit in your terminal window. ConÂ­ firm that running git log -p drops you into a less interface for easier navigation.
  - Yes git log -p is not fitting in my terminal window, which led to less interface with a : at the bottom where to perform opeations on the log.
3. Use your knowledge of less commands to search for the commit that added the HTML DOCTYPE. What is the SHA of the commit?
  - I could find the commit for add DOCTYPE.
  - commit bfffab33fc2b679d535c41e9f11820ad55358a63
