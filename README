#### First command with https giving the status code of 200. 200 means okay and curl is able to get the page by browing the https url.
#### Second command with no https is actually trying to call the http version of the url learnenough.com. Where http is implicit. When its calling the url without https, its redirecting the curl to actual website with https, where the redirection code is 301.
